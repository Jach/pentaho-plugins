QUICK START:

If you're deploying locally, set your kettle.dir and pentaho.dir (BI server)
properties in the build.properties file, then run:

ant deploy-local-both

which will build and install both the BI plugin and the PDI plugin. You should
just need to restart each server for the changes to take effect.
If you just want one or the other, there are separate tasks:

ant deploy-local-bi
ant deploy-local-pdi

If you want to package up a binary distribution for unzipping yourself
or to deploy on a remote server, simply run:

ant package-both

which will leave 2 ...Plugin.zip files in bi/build/ and pdi/build/ respectively.
Extraction paths match as if the root of the BI plugin is "biserver-ce/", and
as if the root of the PDI plugin is "kettle/plugins/spoon/".

WARNINGS:

Please use the ant build.xml script in this directory rather than directly
using the ones in the subdirectories.

Do not run both at the same time if you want two separate LucidDB
instances! Whichever LucidDB instance was started first takes precedence
over any others that may try to start.

LucidDB relies on symoblic links; if ant cannot find the "tar" command you will
have to untar the downloaded tarball yourself.

USING THE BI PLUGIN:

A LucidDB button should appear on the button menu, simply click on it
to launch the AdminUI. To manually start/stop the LucidDB server,
there are menu items under Tools. (Note: if Luciddb.start.db.on.plugin.startup
was changed to False, you will have to manually start it.)

Default login to the database is username sa with no password.

USING THE PDI PLUGIN:

A new LucidDB Perspective should appear in the upper-right corner, click to
switch to it. The Admin should launch automatically, but there are manual
controls on the top to start and stop LucidDB, launch a new Admin Tab,
and even starting and stopping the Admin Server (which serves the Admin UI).

Default login to the database is username sa with no password.
