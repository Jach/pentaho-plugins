Quick start:

Set your kettle.dir and pentaho.dir (BI server) properties in the
build.properties file, then run:

ant deploy-both

which will build and install both the BI plugin and the PDI plugin. You should
just need to restart each for the changes to take effect. If you just want one
or the other, there are separate tasks:

ant deploy-bi
ant deploy-pdi


Warnings:

LucidDB relies on symoblic links; if ant cannot find the "tar" command you will
have to untar the downloaded tarball yourself.

Using the BI plugin:

LucidDb should appear in the plugin menu, simply double-click
LucidDbAdmin.luciddb.

Using the PDI plugin:

A new LucidDB Perspective should appear in the upper-right corner, open it,
start the LucidDb and Jetty servers, and the app should load. Be sure to stop
them before quitting; it is to be determined if this task can be automated as
in the BI plugin.
